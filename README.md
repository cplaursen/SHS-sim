# SHS-sim
Simulator for stochastic hybrid programs.
To build and run, install the haskell tool [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/), and run
```bash
stack install
```
This will pull all dependencies and build everything - though it may take a while.

See usage in my thesis. The executable installed is `stochastic_hybrid_sim`
